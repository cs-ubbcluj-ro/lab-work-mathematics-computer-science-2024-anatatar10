Lex Program Documentation

Overview:
This Lex program scans a source code file (prime_numbers_problem.txt) and generates two outputs:
1. Symbol Table (ST): A table containing unique identifiers (ID) and constants (CONST) found in the code.
2. Program Internal Form (PIF): A list of tokens, including keywords, operators, separators, identifiers, and constants with references to the Symbol Table.

Key Functionalities:

- Keywords: Recognizes and prints common keywords such as int, if, else, etc., into the PIF but not into the Symbol Table.
- Identifiers (ID): Adds unique identifiers to the Symbol Table and references them in the PIF.
- Constants (CONST): Adds numeric and character constants to the Symbol Table and references them in the PIF.
- Operators: Recognizes operators like +, -, *, /, and writes them into the PIF.
- Relational Operators: Recognizes relational operators (==, <, <=, etc.) and writes them into the PIF.
- Separators: Recognizes separators such as (), {}, ,, ;, and writes them into the PIF.
- Lexical Errors: Detects invalid characters and prints an error message with the line and column number, and the type of error.

Functions:

1. addSymbol(const char* name, const char* type):
Adds a symbol (identifier or constant) to the Symbol Table and assigns it a unique index.

2. getSymbolIndex(const char* name):
Returns the index of a symbol from the Symbol Table. If not found, returns -1.

3. reportLexicalError(const char* errorType, const char* token, int line, int column):
Reports detailed lexical errors, specifying the type, token, and its location (line and column).

Error Handling:
If the program encounters an unrecognized character, it outputs an error message in the format:
Lexical Error at line X, column Y: Invalid character - 'Z'

Program Flow:
1. The input source file (prime_numbers_problem.txt) is opened.
2. The Symbol Table is created in ST.out and the Program Internal Form is created in PIF.out.
3. Lexical analysis is performed, and tokens are either added to the PIF or Symbol Table.
4. Any unrecognized characters trigger lexical errors with line and column numbers.
5. The files are closed after analysis is complete.

Example Output:

Symbol Table (ST):
1: a (ID)
2: 3 (CONST)
3: b (ID)

Program Internal Form (PIF):
int : 0
ID : 1
= : 0
CONST : 2
+ : 0
ID : 3
; : 0
